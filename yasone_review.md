- For us, the key point of the report is whether Yasone 1-3 exist at all (the referee is certainly not convinced!), or whether they appear so by an unfortunate combination of issues with bright stars, star-galaxy separation, or some other systematic effect. We also thought that it would be a good idea to follow the referee’s suggestion, and to revisit Fig. 5.
  -  Further information about the GTC cutouts in this figure would be welcome, such as star/galaxy separation, magnitude limits, etc. 
  - A few simple plots would also be helpful, such as a plot of all point sources in the fields (without highlighting them, all same symbols/color/size), before smoothing, as well as density maps with smaller smoothing kernel, or even a simple pixelated version of the density map with different pixel sizes.
  -  Two versions of these plots would be especially helpful, one version with all point sources, and another with all point sources that match the isochrones in Figs. 6-8.

# Reviewer coments

I have carefully reviewed the submitted manuscript by Untzaga et al., which presents a search for hyper-compact clusters in the Milky Way, the detection and putative confirmation of 3 faint Milky Way satellites, and the detection of 17 additional candidate HCC/HCC-like systems. I read the manuscript with great interest, as the detection of multiple new ultra-faint MW satellites with the properties described here would represent a significant observational advance. I commend the authors for undertaking the difficult challenge of searching for stellar overdensities in the dense Galactic plane region. 

At the conclusion of my review, however, I had major reservations that the three new satellites that they report as 'confirmed' with deep imaging (Yasone-1, Yasone-2, Yasone-3) are at least equally likely to be false-positive detections. In addition, I had significant concerns about multiple aspects of the authors’ characterization analyses, particularly with regard to their measurements of the candidate morphologies, absolute magnitudes/luminosities, and proper motion dispersions. These measurements, and other aspects of their analysis, often use less traditional methods and lack explanation in the text necessary to enable reproducibility. At times, confidence intervals vs. upper limits are referenced interchangeably in a manner that is inappropriate.

Based on the above, I cannot recommend publication at this time. However, I do believe that the manuscript makes an interesting addition to the literature – especially given the discovery of at least one system that is clearly real, Yasone-5 – and I hope that with major dedicated revisions to the analysis and text, the manuscript can become suitable for publication in MNRAS. I have endeavored to provide as specific suggestions as possible, but I encourage the authors to go beyond my suggestions if there are further lines of evidence they are aware of that makes the highlighted 3 detections more convincing. I stress that my ability to recommend this work for publication is not contingent on the reality of the candidates, and instead, I primarily hope to encourage the the authors to more deeply investigate the robustness of their results and to ensure that candidates presented as "confirmed" are indeed reliable. 

## The Nature of Yasone 1, 2, and 3 

My concerns about the systems Yasone 1-2-3 are fourfold: 

1.  the stellar density structure of the GTC fields are affected by saturated/bloomed bright sources, potentially leading to spatially inhomogeneous source detection and an overestimation of the significance of the putative detections in the smoothed maps
2. the apparent radial profile (and to a lesser extent the color-magnitude diagram) of putative member sources in the authors' GTC data show some anomalous features
3.  there is no clearly-presented evidence for a proper motion overdensity for any of the three candidates. A common thread among these three concerns is that various presentation choices in Figure 5-10 may inadvertently conspire to over-emphasize the significance of the detections. 
4. Finally, I found it puzzling that the candidates seem to have been selected based on the presence of PS1 stars that they predominantly later reject as system members, implying there is not necessarily a clear connection between the brighter Gaia/PS1 stars that drove the overdensity detection and the fainter GTC stars. I detail each of these points further below.

(1) Figure 5 in the manuscript shows the GTC follow-up images of the fields centered on these candidates (top), and a smoothed stellar density map of the detected sources (bottom). Such cutout images are often the best tool for confirming compact MW satellites, but I generally found the top panels here to be unhelpful to judge these candidates, as the spatial scales are too large to see the putative small-scale stellar overdensities. More clearly, these images do reveal that the smoothed maps in the bottom panels display significant underdensities in regions that directly correspond to areas with bright stars; this is especially true for Yasone-2 where there also appears to be a background overdensity of high significance as well. These features suggest to me a high degree of spatially-variable photometric incompleteness and generally raises concerns about the robustness of the candidate overdensities: it appears plausible that these detections could arise from the contrast between overdense/underdense regions with and without these bright sources. This type of behavior near bright sources is also among the most common origins of false-positive detections in MW satellite searches, in my own experience. 

I also found it to be concerning that there appear to be reasonably large spatial offsets between the region of highest density in the smoothed maps and the (0,0) positions, the latter of which I assume is set to the candidate centroid that the authors report in Table 2. This most applies to Yasone-2, for which I estimate >15” offsets in each coordinate component. No description is provided about how they determined the centroids of each candidate for their search nor their characterization analysis (nor are uncertainties provided), and thus it is difficult to understand whether this discrepancy has implications for all the analyses that follow. As a general statement, though, the lack of a well defined centroid position would be a concerning feature for a satellite candidate with a very small angular size (~25”) where it should otherwise be reasonably well-constrained from samples of ~30-40 stars. 

To investigate these issues and improve the presentation, I suggest that the authors take the following steps: 

(**Critical**) I ask that the authors explicitly add the assumed centroids, smoothing kernel size, and magnitude limits in the figure caption to Figure 5. Please also clarify: do these maps include all stars, or only isochrone-filtered sources? It would also be beneficial to indicate the significance levels for the contours shown in the smoothed maps, since here it seems there are background overdensities that seem not all that different in significance (but this is hard to judge). 

I suggest the authors decrease the smoothing kernel scale for the smoothed maps. This would decrease the impact of the larger-scale structure imposed by the bright stars and would more convincingly demonstrate whether or not there are true local overdensities present.

I suggest the authors adjust the panel sizes such that the top panels are the same size on the page as the bottom panels, and consider marking the approximate regions occupied by the brightest stars in the smoothed maps. While it is good that the same angular scale is shown, it is difficult to intercompare the top and bottom rows of panels at present because the plot sizes are different. 

Consider including inset panels zoomed in on the putative satellite. If they are clearly visually present in the images, as is very often the case for other faint MW satellites with similar angular sizes, then the above concerns are significantly diminished. 


(2) Figures 6-10 raise related concerns, because the candidates reported do not appear to show spatial distributions consistent with standard radial profile models. Specifically, it appears that Yasone 2 is ‘ringlike’ in morphology - underdense in the center - and Yasone 3 is ‘clumpy’ without a clear central overdensity within r_{½} (particularly in the bottom row of Fig8). These morphologies contrast with those seen in other extremely faint MW satellites (see e.g., the Kim 3 system that is sparser than the candidates shown here but uniformly fills the half-light radius ellipse; [https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1512.03530&data=05%7C02%7Cdboyea%40uvic.ca%7C9c0a391b655e4039567808de1ddf1dfc%7C9c61d3779894427cb13b1d6a51662b4e%7C0%7C0%7C638981041314015261%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fAdOtRVPSbtrEMtUfc%2FCgY7dZd993mmBg7WjIPimhhI%3D&reserved=0)](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fpdf%2F1512.03530&data=05|02|dboyea@uvic.ca|9c0a391b655e4039567808de1ddf1dfc|9c61d3779894427cb13b1d6a51662b4e|0|0|638981041314015261|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D|0|||&sdata=fAdOtRVPSbtrEMtUfc%2FCgY7dZd993mmBg7WjIPimhhI%3D&reserved=0)). Given that N~40 stars per system is not especially small, this behavior seems unexpected and is what initially raised my suspicions that these detections may be false positives. The large point sizes chosen for the stellar members in blue may inadvertently have obscured this fact because they de-emphasize the observed sparsity within r_1/2.

To this end, I ask that the authors take the following steps: 
(**Critical**) The authors should make all datapoints in these figures the same (or very similar) dot size in both the spatial plots and the CMDs. Varying the colors alone should be sufficient to make the authors’ point.

(**Critical**) The authors should include the radial profiles centered on each candidate and show how these relate to the reported candidate sizes. This will quickly establish (or refute) whether there is the expected central overdensity that smoothly transitions to a smooth background.

The CMD comparisons relative to the background annulus shown in Figures 6-10 provide the strongest evidence for these candidates, but they are complicated to interpret because the photometric scatter is very large about the best-fit isochrones. One reason for this at the bright end could potentially be the unusual choice to present distinct photometric datasets in the same CMD: I strongly suggest the authors present just the GTC photometry rather than merge the PS1 and GTC data in this manner. The stars that are also in Gaia/PS1 could simply be circled/colored differently.

In addition, the authors should demonstrate (either internally or in the manuscript) that the choice of background annulus is not affected by the bright star issue described above. It is claimed in the manuscript that the choice of annulus is unimportant, but this should be re-evaluated with this possible issue in mind. Because comparing to annuli with very small angular sizes is inherently noisy and does not always offer a meaningful sampling of the field population, the authors might also consider presenting a CMD of all sources in the field, with the sources within, say, 2r_{½} highlighted in a different color, or alternatively present a Hess diagram.

(3) The authors purport to show that the three candidates represent kinematic overdensities, based in part on a pairwise significance test. This is a very good idea, but I feel that the tests are insufficiently described in the text and the results are not clearly demonstrated. The existing Figure 9 does not clearly support the authors’ claims, particularly because the pointsize/coloring of the background sample has been visually de-emphasized to the point that they are nearly indiscernible in the figure; even when inspected closely, there does not appear to be anything unique about the three stars that the authors’ have highlighted in color / circled in blue. 

To help convince the reader whether an overdensity is present, I urge the authors to significantly elaborate on these tests and demonstrate the results of their tests with a figure that shows these are significant detections. For Figure 9, the authors might consider adding panels showing the spatial distribution of sources after the kinematic filtering only, which would make clear whether or not the presence of three stars with similar proper motions in the approximate region centered on Yasone 1,2,3 is a significant feature. Alternatively, the authors could present the proper motion field after filtering with the best-fit isochrone. While not essential, it would also be beneficial for future follow-up efforts if the authors presented tables with the corresponding Gaia/PS1 stars reported with ID/position and their proper motions.

(4) Finally, the authors mention that these three candidates (and all the PS1 candidates) were identified in the author’s search because they had a significant number (10+) of stars at g < 21 in PS1 within a small angular region, and it is later stated in Line 52 that candidates with promising isochrone-tracing populations were the subject of continued analysis. Yet the CMDs in Figures 6-10 seem to suggest that at most ~4-5 PS1 stars per system are plausible Yasone 1-2-3 members based on the best-fit isochrones. If this is true, it would seem that the true overdensities associated with each candidate are ~half as significant as the initial search results would suggest, and, equally, that one could commonly find 5 tightly-clustered but physically-unassociated PS1 stars at g<21 in a r~25” region of sky. This latter point seems to be emphasized by the background annuli CMDs, where there are a number of red giants consistent with the best-fit isochrone in each field. I wonder then: is it possible that most/all of the PS1/Gaia stars in Yasone 1-2-3 are a chance alignment with no physical association to each other? This could be true even if the fainter stars seen in GTC constitute a real stellar system.

The most convincing tests to address this concern would be to evaluate whether the overdensities associated with each candidate persist in the case where (a) isochrone-filtering was applied to the PS1 dataset in each candidate’s field, and (b) if all the stars at g < 22 are removed (i.e., retain only the fainter stars detected by only GTC and not PS1/Gaia). If these are both true, it seems significantly more likely that these are true satellite detections. The authors might consider these variants as they revise Figure 5 based on the suggestions from earlier in this report.


## Comments on Characterization Analyses

My second set of comments relate to the author’s characterization analyses, which are sparsely described in the text and seem to rely on less traditional methods. To enable reproducibility, the authors should significantly expand their descriptions for how they measured each property, ideally in a central location in the main text and not in footnotes/Table notes. Based on my current understand of the procedures applied, these items came to my attention: 

Centroid and size: as noted earlier in my report, it is not specified how the centroids of each candidate nor their sizes are determined, and there are possible offsets between the most dense region in the smoothed map and the centroid in Table 2. The authors refer to the work of Martin et al. 2008 in their caption to Table 2, but as far as I am aware, they do not apply these fitting methods in practice and thus I found this table note to be misleading. At minimum, it is **critical** that the authors explicitly state how the centroid and sizes were determined/fit in the main text and show the observed radial profile. It would be my strong recommendation that the authors go beyond this suggestion and adopt more common parametric profile-fitting procedures (e.g. that of Martin et al. 2008, 2011), as these would also be quite informative for vetting the reality of the candidates further – for example, parametric radial profile fits will quickly fail to converge to sensible results if a given candidate is indeed a false positive. The data in hand is not especially sparse compared to other MW satellites where such fits have been performed.

Absolute Magnitude/Luminosity/Mass: the authors refer to their own absolute magnitude / stellar mass estimates as lower limits, but I consider this to be an unjustifiable simplification (and one that is inconsistent with the presentation in Figure 4 and the abstract). The authors should adopt a method that, at minimum, accounts for the magnitude limit of their data (and ideally the photometric incompleteness as well) and allows for meaningful confidence intervals. My strong recommendation would be that the authors re-measure absolute magnitudes following the procedure of Martin et al. (2008), which would also have the benefit of accounting for the stochastic sampling of the RGB in low-mass systems. 

Lastly, I believe it would be best to remove the proper motion dispersion measurements entirely from the manuscript, since they are insufficiently constrained to offer meaningful insight into the candidates, are highly degenerate with the choice of brighter member stars that are included, and do not properly treat the systematic uncertainties and upper limits in such a way that the resulting measurements are expected to be reliable. If the authors wish to retain these measurements, they should explicitly describe the method used to compute them (e.g, include or cite the assumed likelihood and their method for deriving parameter estimates and uncertainties) and how the set of member stars was selected. They should also make justifiable choices about whether a dispersion is an upper limit; for example, the measurement for Yasone-2 of sigma_v ~ 59 plus/minus 35 km/s that the authors present as possible evidence for an IMBH is consistent with 0 at the < 2 sigma level, and it therefore seems inconclusive whether there is a real dispersion present.

## Other remarks

\- In general, there is no description in the text about how photometry and photometric calibration was performed for the GTC images, nor any description of photometric completeness or star/galaxy separation. Star/galaxy separation is expected to be a major concern at magnitudes as faint as r~25-26, and is likely a more significant challenge for images with seeing on the upper end of the values listed in Table 1. The authors should, at minimum, describe how the photometry and photometric calibration was performed and how star/galaxy separation was carried out. 

-Did the authors consider adding the diagnostic plots for Yasone 6-20 to the paper (like those for Yasone-5 in Figure 10)? Without these, it would be challenging for the community to make judgements about whether to pursue further follow-up on these additional HCC candidates. 

-The authors refer to the Yasone 1-4 candidates as halo systems, though this claim is not a certainty based on their distances. I suggest the authors compute their separations |Z_gal| from the disk plane and perhaps even consider whether their tangential velocities could be more consistent with thick-disk-like orbits or halo-like kinematics. This subtlety is emphasized by the fact that Yasone 5, which the authors associate with the disk, is significantly further from the Galactic center compared to their halo candidates. Relatedly, could Yasone-3 be related to the Sagittarius dSph given its sky-projected position? 

\- It is stated that "all identified overdensities are located at a minimum angular separation of 1′ from any known object, and each is flagged as a statistically significant density outlier.” However, in the plane region, this is not a trivial statement given the thousands of open cluster detections across many literature studies. I ask that the authors specify the external catalogs they have checked the 20 candidates against. It may be necessary to also explore a larger region around each detection, as 1 arcminute is less than the expected total radii of each candidate out to their outermost stars.

\- The authors do not describe whether extinction/reddening corrections were applied to their CMDs in Figures 6-10. I assume these are deredenned: if so, I suggest the authors make this clear in the axes labels or elsewhere. Are available extinction maps (e.g., SFD98/SF11) consistent with the A_V values that the authors derive from their isochrone fits?

\- Footnote 1: the authors suggest Marleau et al. (2024)'s Figure 2 shows a boundary between GCs and ultra-faint dwarfs. However, the figure that the authors refer to includes no globular clusters and is limited to satellites at M_V > -8 and thereby excludes all but a few known UFDs based on the Simon (2019) definition. The authors should reference a different paper in support of this point.
