Hi Simon and Julio,

I’m sending you a .zip with 6 .csv files, two for each candidate. This means you’ll have information for Yasone-1, Yasone-2, and Yasone-3; and for each one, the “_g” version and the “_r” version.

The reason for this is that some member stars were confirmed in CMDs that used the (g−r) color (corresponding to the .csv ending in “_g”), and others in the (r−i) color (corresponding to the .csv ending in “_r”).

The vast majority of the sources you’ll see for a given candidate are the same in the “_g” version as in the “_r” version, but some stars are only detected in one of the two.

A small mistake I realized too late is that in Table 2 of the paper we published, I counted only the member stars detected by GTC (i.e., the total number of unique detections across all the bands observed in the Canary Islands). For this reason, the .csv files you’ll see contain some additional sources, corresponding to stars that, besides appearing in GTC, are also detected by PanSTARRS and Gaia. For example, although Table 2 states that Yasone-1 has 42 unique member stars, in reality it would be 46 (+1 from PanSTARRS and +3 from Gaia). In the .csv files I’ve added a column with the catalog each star “belongs to,” to make this easier to see.

Aside from that, you’ll see that some stars are located in slightly different positions depending on whether they are observed in the “g” band or the “r” band, which in some cases made me doubt whether to consider a light source as a single star or as two different ones. I mention this in case your final count ends up with a star more or less than expected.

I hope the study is fruitful for you.

Best regards,
Julen
